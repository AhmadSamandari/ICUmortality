# ICUmortality
Building an ANN model to predict mortality rate in ICU. The project is based on two-phase, (i) 42 ICU measures from 3999 patients undergo feature engineering (utilizing Heatmap) to extract most correlated features (ii) ANN model designed utilizing Dense, Dropout and BatchNormalization layers, and Accuracy of 0.88 was achieved. All the computations done in Google Colab environment.
